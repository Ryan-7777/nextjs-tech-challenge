# Next.js App Router TypeScript Challenge: Product Listing

## Overview

You've been given a Next.js application using the App Router, written in TypeScript, that displays a list of products. The application fetches data from a mock API and renders it on the page. However, the app is not working correctly and has several issues that need to be fixed, including some type-related problems.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ryan-7777/nextjs-tech-challenge`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Task

Your task is to identify and fix the issues in the application. The main problems are:

1. The product list is not rendering correctly.
2. There's an error when fetching data from the mock API.
3. The application has performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders.
4. The routing is not working as expected with the new App Router.
5. Ensure the app compiles and runs as expected.

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly, the application should:

1. Fetch a list of products from the mock API
2. Display the products on the main page
3. Allow users to click on a product to view its details (in a new route)
4. Handle loading and error states gracefully
5. Use proper TypeScript types throughout the application

## Bonus

If you complete the main tasks quickly, consider implementing the following improvements:

1. Implement proper error handling using error.tsx
2. Add loading states using loading.tsx
3. Implement a search functionality to filter products using server actions

Good luck! Feel free to ask any questions if you need clarification.
